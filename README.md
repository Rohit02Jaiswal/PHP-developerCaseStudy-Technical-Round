Hi I'm Rohit Jaiswal
The purpose of this repo is to upload my task which is given in my Technical round of Techsolv IT Service.
# PHP Test: The Perfect Contact Us Form Development.
Suppose I have a client who owns a renown beauty salon. She has a form on the index page where people can contact her if they have any questions.
Firstly I have created index page "index.php". For style I have created a css file "style.css".
Now the use of "connect.php" is to connect the database. For database I have used phpMyAdmin. All pages are locally hosted on my Localhost Apache server. Creating a MySQL database table "contact_form" to store the form submission.
All the backend functionallities are written in "saloon.php" file. Each of the fields are validated by PHP code.
